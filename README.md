Learning to code should be easy, fun and especially free! Cursor is here to solve just that. Learn JavaScript, Python (Coming soon!) and much more. Courses are short, sweet and to the point, requiring no prior knowledge to get started.

- No sign up required
- No data tracking
- Always free, never a paid tier
- Learn at your own pace
- New courses every week
